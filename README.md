This component generates `HTML` code for a `<link>` tag with an emoji favicon.
The favicon is an embedded `<svg>`.

Search for the emoji you want on the left pane, and when you click it the code
will be generated on the right pane. You can then copy the code with the copy
button and paste the code into the `<head>` of your `HTML` document.
